			<p>This portfolio is very strong because it starts off with a video right away featuring their work in a very quick and snappy way. It is also very clean and shows a logo and name in the beginning. The portfolio is very minimalistic and quickly says what the person does then has a contact link. However I like how after that, it brings the work back on the bottom but as images so employers can take a longer look.

			<p>The portfolio is very fun, colorful, and creative. I like how the scrolling has unique tranistions from one image to the next. Every button has its own transistion even the button for taking a closer look at the work. I like how minimal it is and starts off with nice big visuals to hook users but ones the image is clicked on, he has a very organized set of information. I also like the subtle hint on the tab bar that describes the person's personality himself.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://merijnhos.com/">Merijn's Portfolio</a></h2>
			<p>This portfolio contains a large amount of high quality portfolio peices/illustrations. I really like how simple it is and straight to the point, I think it does an effective job showcasing the persons work and I also like how under each image there is a simple description about what they did or what kind of work it is. I also like how once you click on the image, it shows you what that image would look like on different objects to showcase what their work would look like. Finally, after clicking the image, the site has a good flow to it because you can scroll down to see more art work</p>

			<p>I like how unique this site took with its layout. I like how all the tabs and sections are to the left side with a clean logo then all the work takes up the middle area in a nice compelling way. Then when you click on the image, I like how there is a brief description of what they did and why, then has multiple images to support what they did along with renders of what their product could look like in real life. I also like what they did when you keep scrolling down where it brings the user back to the other images of the portfolio just like the previous site.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://robinmastromarino.com/">Robin's Portfolio</a></h2>
			<p>In my opinion, this one is the most unique portfolio because the site is very clean, interactive, and visually exciting. If you look closely, the image has a water-like aniamtion going on top of it. It's simple but subtly complex and nothing is static. Scrolling through their images is also very different than what the others have and I also like how subtle the other links are to the about me page and social media. I also like the smooth transition you get once images are clicked on so it feels smooth and seemless to get the information. The information is very brief and then it goes straight into more detailed images related to the main picture clicked on while scrolling through it is also animated to make it more professinal.</p>
