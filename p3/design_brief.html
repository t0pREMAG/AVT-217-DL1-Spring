<h1>The Research</h1>
<p>Through looking at other portfolios, I found a few common themes that I should apply to mine. First, they were all simple and easy to navigate, this doesn't mean to include fancy transitions and what not because even the more simple ones were able to effectively showcase their work without all the fancy tricks.
Lastly, all the portfolios included the most important work and information needed, there was no filler work just to fill up space, only the best of what they could create was included.</p>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
