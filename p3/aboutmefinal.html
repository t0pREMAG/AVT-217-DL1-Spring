	<img src="img/andre.jpg" id="" alt="andre"><div class="about"><p>My name is Andre Tran and I am a student at George Mason University in the Computer Game Design Program. I am also in the process of getting a minor in Art and Visual Technology and Information Technology. I like to spend time with my freinds and family by eating out, trying new things, adventuring out, and staying active. In terms of work, I stay focused at the task in hand while helping the rest of the team whenever I can. I am a huge team player but that doesn't mean I'm not independent, I stay true to my word and responsible when it comes to my time management and work load. </p></div>
